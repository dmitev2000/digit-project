            <h2><strong>Our Heritage</strong></h2>
            <div style={{maxWidth:"90%"}}>
            <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was
                here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from
                around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,”
                evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.</p>

            <p>Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become
                captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different
                cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard
                first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and
                artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and
                embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.</p>

            <p> Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, Washington, D.C.
                and New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed by Europe
                in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome millions of customers
                each week and become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all around the world. In
                everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one
                person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.
